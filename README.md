# Monitoring and Logging Solution for Kubernetes Cluster

This document outlines the steps to set up a comprehensive monitoring and logging solution for a Kubernetes cluster without using Helm charts. The solution involves deploying a sample application, configuring Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and setting up an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for log collection and visualization.

## 1. Prerequisites

- A functioning Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured

## 2. Deployment

Deploy a sample application on the Kubernetes cluster using your preferred deployment method.

## 3. Monitoring Setup

### 3.1 Prometheus

1. Create a Prometheus deployment manifest and apply it to the cluster.
2. Configure Prometheus to scrape the sample application's metrics by specifying the appropriate service endpoints.

### 3.2 Grafana

1. Create a Grafana deployment manifest and apply it to the cluster.
2. Access Grafana's web interface, configure Prometheus as a data source, and import predefined dashboards or create custom ones.

## 4. Logging Setup

### 4.1 Elasticsearch

1. Deploy an Elasticsearch cluster using a deployment manifest.
2. Configure Elasticsearch for data storage.

### 4.2 Logstash

1. Create a Logstash deployment manifest and apply it to the cluster.
2. Configure Logstash to parse and forward logs from the sample application to Elasticsearch.

### 4.3 Kibana

1. Deploy Kibana using a deployment manifest.
2. Access Kibana's web interface and set up an index pattern for the application logs.

## 5. Dashboard and Visualizations

### 5.1 Grafana Dashboard

1. Create a Grafana dashboard manifest and apply it to the cluster.
2. Configure panels and graphs in the dashboard to monitor key metrics over time.

### 5.2 Kibana Visualization

1. Access Kibana's web interface and create visualizations that highlight error logs over time.
